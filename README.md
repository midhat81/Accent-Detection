# Accent-Detection
Accent Detection Tool identifies English accents (American, British, Australian, Canadian) from uploaded or linked videos using speech recognition and keyword analysis. Built with Python and Streamlit for easy use.
Built using Python, this tool leverages SpeechRecognition, pydub, and Streamlit for UI. It uses Google Speech-to-Text API and rule-based keyword matching for accent classification. Audio is extracted from video using FFmpeg (via pydub), and analysis is based on linguistic feature patterns across major English accents.
